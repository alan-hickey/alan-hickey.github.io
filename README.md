Hi, I'm Alan Hickey. Welcome to my website.

I am a Stage 3 Electrical Engineering student in University College Dublin, and I have a passion for using the skills I'm learning to help improve how we interact with the world around us. I like to think of engineering as a way of using science and mathematics to help improve our lives. Engineering is about problem-solving, creativity, innovation and so much more, and it holds the key to solving so many of the problems we face.

I'm a hard worker. I set high standards for myself and I believe in always putting my best foot forward. I value the importance of speaking up _and_ listening to what others have to say. I enjoy working and interacting with other people.

I am very interested Electrical Power Systems, and in particular how Electrical Power Systems can be made more sustainable through the use of renewables without sacrificing the security of supply we currnetly enjoy. I also have a growing interest in the economic factors that influence decisions made in choosing one solution over another, because I understand that real world solutions need to be efficient and make economic sense to implement.

This website is in development, this is just the beginning.
